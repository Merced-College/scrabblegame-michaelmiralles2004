**The following is a personal report reflecting on what I have learned throughout this project.**

As I worked on this programming project, I saw noticeable improvement in my understanding of object-oriented programming.
When I first started this Scrabble-like game, I had a general idea of classes and constructors, but limited experience
working with them. I did a lot of research on Java and really trying to understand the language, I learned how to sort
and search for work using Java's built in methods. I also became more comfortable with using data structures like ArrayList,
and Hashmaps.

One of my biggest challenges was making sure the random letters were being generated could actually form a real word. Initially,
I used a method that picked completely random letters, this wasn't very smart since it often resulted in gibberish. Luckily, I
fixed this by modifying the logic to randomly choose a real 4-letter word from the word list, scramble it, and then give it to the
player. Of course, I also ran into general bugs like not having correct punctuation, incorrect letters, etc.

Overall, this project helped reinforce my object-oriented programming skills, showed me how to use Java'a data structures effectively,
and was overall fun to overcome and work on.
